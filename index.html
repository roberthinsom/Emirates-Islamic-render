            <p>The Emirates Islamic RTA card is used to pay for various transport services in Dubai. The cost of using the card depends on factors such as the mode of transport, the number of zones crossed, and the distance traveled.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Dubai Metro and Tram Fare</h3>
            <p>The Dubai Metro and Tram operate on a zonal fare system, where the fare is determined by how many zones you pass through. The rates are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 Zone</strong>: AED 3</li>
                <li><strong>2 Zones</strong>: AED 5</li>
                <li><strong>3 Zones</strong>: AED 7.5</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Fare (all zones)</strong>: AED 10</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The fare is automatically deducted from your Emirates Islamic RTA card balance as you travel.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Dubai Bus Fare</h3>
            <p>The fare for Dubai’s bus network is also zone-based. However, bus fares tend to be slightly lower than those for metro and tram travel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 Zone</strong>: AED 3</li>
                <li><strong>2 Zones</strong>: AED 4.5</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Water Transport (Water Bus, Water Taxi)</h3>
            <p>If you prefer water transport, the Emirates Islamic RTA card can be used to pay for trips on water buses and water taxis, though the fare will depend on the route:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Bus</strong>: AED 3 to AED 5 per trip.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Taxi</strong>: AED 10 to AED 50 per trip, depending on the service and distance.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Parking</strong>: AED 2 per hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Locations</strong>: Parking rates can be higher depending on the zone and proximity to major attractions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Additional Services and Fees</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Nol Card Integration</h3>
            <p>The Emirates Islamic RTA card functions similarly to the Nol Card, which is the general electronic ticketing system used by RTA. If you already own a Nol Card, you can use the Emirates Islamic RTA card for the same range of services, but it may require you to top up separately.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Lost or Stolen Card Replacement Fees</h3>
            <p>If you lose your Emirates Islamic RTA card or it gets stolen, you can report it to the RTA and request a replacement. However, a fee is charged for issuing a new card:</p>

                <li><strong>Non-Personalized Card Replacement</strong>: AED 20.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.3 Refund Process</h3>
            <p>If you no longer need your Emirates Islamic RTA card, you can request a refund for the remaining balance at an RTA customer service center. However, a small administrative fee may be deducted from the refunded amount.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>6. Discounts and Promotions for Cardholders</h2>
            <p>To make the Emirates Islamic RTA card more affordable for specific groups of people, the RTA offers discounts on fares. These discounts are available to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Students</strong>: Special discounted fares for students using an RTA card.</li>
                <li><strong>Senior Citizens</strong>: People aged 60 or above can enjoy discounted rates on public transport services.</li>
